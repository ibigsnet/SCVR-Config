Warning! This will overright your current resolution, fov, window mode and vsync settings for Star Citizen (the attributes.xml file)

1) Place both SCVR.exe and SCVR.json next to your attributes file

	Default location is C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\LIVE\user\client\0\Profiles\default\

2) Run SCVR.exe
	Select your headset (and lens configuration if applicable)
	Select your resolution
	
3)	DONE!



Updated to now give additional optional resolutions, should you want more options. I think I'm done working on this for a bit, there was enough changes to the code, that I'm just going to call it 2.0. This will probably ultimately be merged with the Kaglaaz's SCVR-Settings program.

Feel free to create a desktop shortcut so that you can switch between resolutions easily.

Version 2.0


Special thanks to Cachi, Kaglaaz <3
